## What is Rest API

**API: Application Programming Interface**

If you want to interact with the application you reach for the interface.

**_Example:_**

I have an application which is Youtube and I want to interact with this 
application from my own application by grabbing a list of videos from a 
certain person's Youtube channel. 

Youtube provides an interface so I can interact with it and theses interface 
would be a series of endpoint to search for a particular video.

So if we want to find some videos from Youtube application then we are 
going to use these endpoints and we're going to use them from our code.

We are calling this application and using the interface from our code 
as in Application Programming Inferface(API).
