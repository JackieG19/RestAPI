What is Rest API?

** API:
Application Programming Interface

If you want to interact with the application you reach for the interface.

Example:
I have an application which is Youtube and I want to interact with this 
application from my own application by grabbing a list of videos from a 
certain person's Youtube channel.

Youtube provides an interface so I can interact with it and theses interface 
would be a series of endpoint to search for a particular video.

So if we want to find some videos from Youtube application then we are 
going to use these endpoints and we're going to use them from our code.

We are calling this application and using the interface from our code 
as in Application Programming Inferface(API).


** Rest:
Representaitional State Transfer

- Architectual style of the web
- A standard / set of guidelines by which we can structure and create API's 
- REST API's have identifiable properties:
    They make use of resource based URL's
    - webpage browser: request the html, css, and javascript
    - interact with API: return some json data
    
Rest properties:

--Use of HTTP methods--
GET - used to retrieve data from server
POST - used to send data to the server
PUT - used to updata data
DELETE - used to delete data

--Use of HTTP status codes--
200 - means ok
404 - means resource not found
500 - means server error


A package.json file contains infromation about the project and tracks dependencies

To create the package file:
npm init -y
- autofill the package.json file

Making an application on node.js using express.
Express is a package that can be install on nodeJS which is going 
to make things such as listening to request and handling them.

To install express:
npm install express --save
- this with save into the dependencies in the package.json file

Nodemon
npm install nodemon --save-dev
- its a dev dependencies that isn't required for the application to run
- its a dependency that is going to speed up the development process
